# Introduction
ECMAScript is a scripting programming language standardized by ECMA International 
(formerly the European Computer Manufacturers Association) through ECMA-262. 
The language is widely used on the World Wide Web, and it is often referred to as JavaScript or JScript, 
so it can be understood as a standard for JavaScript, 
but in fact the latter two are implementations and extensions of the ECMA-262 standard
